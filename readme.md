## Introduction

In the United States, women have earned a larger share of bachelor’s degrees than men for several decades. This trend has important implications for the landscape of higher education and societal changes related to gender equality in education. The rise of women earning bachelor's degrees is a significant milestone and has shaped various aspects of the labor force, social dynamics, and economic opportunities.

## Historical Overview

The trend of women earning a larger share of bachelor’s degrees began in the early 1980s, with women surpassing men in the total number of degrees awarded. By the 1981–1982 academic year, women were receiving more bachelor's degrees than men, a shift that marked a significant moment in the history of U.S. higher education.

Since then, the gap has continued to widen, with more women graduating from colleges and universities, and this has had lasting effects on various educational and professional outcomes.
